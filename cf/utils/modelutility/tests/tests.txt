* heavy.obj
It was exported by Max, it only has two values in the vertex specifies for each face vertex.
It gives position and texture coordinate and expects the reading application to generate vertex normals.

* sword_demon.obj
It was also exported by Max (prob a different Max, somehow) and has no material specified before the faces begin.
